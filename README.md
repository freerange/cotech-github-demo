Screenshots showing how to add a new cooperative to the Jekyll version of the [CoTech website][jekyll-website].

## Creating a pull request

This sequence of screenshots shows [new-cooperative][] (a GitHub user) creating a pull request using only the GitHub user interface. Note that the user is not a member of the [cotech][] GitHub organisation so a [fork][] of the repository is automatically created. The pull request (now closed) can still be seen [here][pull-request].

## Merging a pull request

This sequence of screenshots shows [floehopper][] who is a member of the [cotech][] GitHub organisation merging the pull request submitted by [new-cooperative][]. This causes the website to be re-generated and as long as there are no errors, the new version is deployed.
